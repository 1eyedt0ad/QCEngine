v0.6.0 / 2019-02-28
-------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

- (:pr:`36`) **breaking change** Model objects are returned by default rather than a dictionary.

New Features
++++++++++++

- (:pr:`18`) Add the ``dftd3`` program to available computers.
- (:pr:`29`) Adds preliminary support for the ``Molpro`` compute engine.
- (:pr:`31`) Moves all computation to ``ProgramExecutor`` to allow for a more flexible input generation, execution, output parsing interface.
- (:pr:`32`) Adds a general ``execute`` process which safely runs subprocess jobs.

Enhancements
++++++++++++

- (:pr:`33`) Moves the ``dftd3`` executor to the new ``ProgramExecutor`` interface.
- (:pr:`34`) Updates models to the more strict QCElemental v0.3.0 model classes.
- (:pr:`35`) Updates CI to avoid pulling CUDA libraries for ``torchani``.
- (:pr:`36`) First pass at documentation.


v0.5.2 / 2019-02-13
-------------------

Enhancements
++++++++++++

- (:pr:`24`) Improves load times dramatically by delaying imports and cpuutils.
- (:pr:`25`) Code base linting.
- (:pr:`30`) Ensures Psi4 output is already returned and Pydantic v0.20+ changes.

v0.5.1 / 2019-01-29
-------------------

Enhancements
++++++++++++

- (:pr:`22`) Compute results are now returned as a dict of Python Primals which have
  been serialized-deserialized through Pydantic instead of returning un-processed Python objects
  or json-compatible string.

v0.5.0 / 2019-01-28
-------------------

New Features
++++++++++++

- (:pr:`8`) Adds the TorchANI program for ANI-1 like energies and potentials.
- (:pr:`16`) Adds QCElemental models based off QCSchema to QCEngine for both validation and object-based manipulation of input and output data.

Enhancements
++++++++++++

- (:pr:`14`) Migrates option to Pydantic objects for validation and creation.
- (:pr:`14`) Introduces NodeDescriptor (for individual node description) and JobConfig (individual job configuration) objects.
- (:pr:`17`) NodeDescriptor overhauled to work better with Parsl/Balsam/Dask/etc.
